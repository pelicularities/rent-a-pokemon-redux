# Rent-A-Pokemon Redux

This is a Rails project that originated from [Le Wagon's](https://github.com/lewagon) Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
It's a marketplace for renting Pokemon to and from other users. I'm sure there's a massive market for such a product.

Our team implemented [Rent-A-Pokemon](https://github.com/konfs/RentAPokemon) in five days.
After the bootcamp, I forked the repository and continued to polish up parts of the UI/UX.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
